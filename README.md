## Data Structure  

BuddyQuest uses a dictionary-based data structure to efficiently store and manage adventures.  

### Storage Format  

```python
adventures = {
    "YYYY-MM-DD": {  # Date as the primary key
        "User1-User2-Category": Count  # User pairs, activity category, and count
    }
}
```

### Example Data  

The adventures are stored in a dictionary with dates as keys. Each date contains another dictionary with adventure keys, which are unique strings combining the user pair and the activity category (e.g., `A-B-Hiking`). The count represents how many times that specific activity was logged on that day.

Example data for two days:

```python
{
    "2025-01-24": {
        "A-B-Hiking": 2,
        "A-C-RoadTrip": 1
    },
    "2025-01-25": {
        "A-B-Foodie_Tour": 1,
        "B-C-Gaming_Session": 3
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- On **2025-01-24**, the adventure `A-B-Hiking` was logged **2 times**, while `A-C-RoadTrip` was logged **1 time**.
- On **2025-01-25**, the adventure `A-B-Foodie_Tour` was logged **1 time**, and `B-C-Gaming_Session` was logged **3 times**.

## Computational Complexity  

| **Parameter**          | **Symbol** | **Definition**                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Number of Users         | `U`        | Total number of users in the system.                                                             |
| User Connections (Pairs)| `C`        | Number of unique user pairs, calculated as `C = U * (U - 1) / 2`.                                 |
| Logged Adventures       | `k`        | Total number of logged activities across all users and pairs.                                     |
| Daily Entries           | `D`        | Number of unique adventures logged per day (proportional to active users).                       |
| Space Required          | `S`        | Total storage required for the adventure data.                                                   |

### Storage Computation  

For `U` users, the total number of unique connections `C` is calculated as:

If each user logs k adventures daily, the total storage required is proportional to:

| Users (U) | Connections (C) | Daily Adventures (D) | Estimated Storage |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| 10        | 45              | 50                    | ~5 KB             |
| 100       | 4,950           | 500                   | ~50 KB            |
| 1,000     | 499,500         | 5,000                 | ~500 KB           |
| 10,000    | 49,995,000      | 50,000                | ~5 MB             |

## Visual Representation

### Growth of Connections with Users

```
Connections (C) = U * (U - 1) / 2  

    U -> Users
    C -> Connections
```

Daily Adventures Logged

D = Active Users Ã— k

Example: 1,000 users logging 5 adventures daily each = 5,000 daily entries.

---

## Scalability

### Challenges
- Large User Base: As users grow, the number of connections increases quadratically.
- Frequent Updates: Logging real-time adventures for many users can be intensive.
- Storage Overhead: Adventure data can grow large, especially with high activity levels.

### Optimizations
- Efficient Storage: Group adventures by date to minimize redundancy.
- Archiving: Periodically summarize or archive older data to save space.
- Lookup Efficiency: Use dictionaries for fast O(1) access to user-pair adventures.
